ActiveNodes
===========

Information processing/sharing by an ActiveNodes hierarchy

The ActiveNodes concept aims at overcoming limitations of existing data representation
methods like file systems along with specific file formats like e.g. XML. The main objective
is to get to a conceptually unlimited data representation. Further, a general way of acting
on data items is intended by this concept. The final goal thus is to allow for working on
any kind of data by defining its inner and outer relations without a need for programming
any software. The intention could shortly be summarized "defining instead of programming".
